# Rails Tutorial for ENEI 2015

This repository contains tutorial code from a workshop I gave at the National
Computer Science Students Meeting in Portugal. 

**This tutorial is aimed at beginners/first commers.**

We built a "clich√©" To Do list application. This repository has several branches
named step-\*, each branch contains code for a specific functionality starting
with step-0 which contains the application scaffold. 

**Master contains the final application code.**
